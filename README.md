# Dog Machine

This is a simple web app made to practice working with APIs and the DOM model using vanilla JavaScript. This website allows you to click "New Dog", which will get you a picture of a random dog from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and will display a short info paragraph about that Dog Breed fetched from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
